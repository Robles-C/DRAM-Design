# DRAM-Design

This work is part of a final project for the course Digital Electronics (ECE442) at CSUN. Below is the abstract of the paper <a href="https://github.com/Robles-C/DRAM-Design/blob/main/Comparative_Analysis_of_SRAM_DRAM.pdf">written</a> for the project.

Abstract—This paper conducts a comparative analysis of
SRAM and DRAM from a designer’s perspective, specifically
focusing on their construction and performance at the CMOS
transistor level. Despite use of similar components like sense
amplifiers, row and column decoders, and equalization and precharge circuits, these two types of RAM show distinct behaviors
and efficiencies. By analyzing how different RAM cells operate
within similar environmental contexts, we seek to clarify the
differences in their design and functionality. This investigation
aims to provide insights into the selection and optimization of
different RAM technologies for various applications.
